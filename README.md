# Enroll and Provision a device (DemoApp)

This project serves as a demonstration of an Application that can be enrolled with on of the [Android Enterprise Work Profiles](https://www.android.com/enterprise/work-profile/)

- [Company-Owned devices for work use only](https://developers.google.com/android/management/provision-device#company-owned_devices_for_work_use_only): Full device management is suitable for company-owned devices intended exclusively for work purposes. Enterprises can manage all apps on the device and can enforce the full spectrum of Android Management API's policies and commands
- [Company-Owned devices for work and personal usage](https://developers.google.com/android/management/provision-device#company-owned_devices_for_work_and_personal_use): Setting up a company-owned device with a work profile enables the device for both work and personal use.
- [Personally-Owned Devices](https://developers.google.com/android/management/provision-device#personally-owned_devices) **NOT SUPPORTED YET**: Devices owned by employees can be set up with a work profile. A work profile provides a self-contained space for work apps and data, separate from personal apps and data. Most app, data, and other management policies apply to the work profile only, while the employee's personal apps and data remain private.
